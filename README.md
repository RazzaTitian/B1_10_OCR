# ClearScan

ClearScan is an innovative web and mobile application designed to empower individuals with partial vision impairment by converting scanned text into natural-sounding speech—both online and offline. Built specifically for high accuracy in the Indonesian language, ClearScan addresses everyday challenges such as reading product packaging, documents, and public signage.

---

## Getting Started with Development

This project utilizes [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and was initialized using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To start the development server, execute:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to preview the application.

Edit `app/page.js` to make changes, and observe auto-updates instantly upon saving the file.

ClearScan also leverages [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for optimized and efficient loading of the Inter font from Google Fonts.

## Background

In Indonesia, approximately 3.7 million individuals experience vision impairments, significantly impacting their daily reading ability. Current solutions like Google Lookout and Seeing AI offer Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) features but are inadequately optimized for the Indonesian language, often requiring stable internet connectivity. ClearScan directly addresses these limitations, providing a specialized, accessible solution tailored specifically for Indonesian users.

---

## Problem Statement

ClearScan aims to solve these critical issues:

- **Empowerment:** Enable independent, comfortable reading for individuals with partial visual impairment.
- **Accuracy:** Improve OCR and TTS specifically for nuanced Indonesian linguistic and accent diversity.
- **Accessibility:** Offer seamless online and offline functionalities within a lightweight and user-friendly platform.
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Deliver a superior, affordable alternative to current solutions.

---

## Proposed Solution

ClearScan employs advanced OCR technology to convert images and documents into digital text, which is then transformed into speech through a sophisticated TTS engine. The application is specifically designed to:

- Accurately recognize Indonesian text.
- Provide consistent offline functionality.
- Incorporate accessible and intuitive features designed specifically for users with partial vision impairment.

---

## Key Features

- **Advanced OCR:** High-speed Indonesian text extraction from images or documents.
- **Offline TTS:** Natural-sounding speech synthesis with offline compatibility and adjustable playback speed.
- **Scan History:** Automatic saving of scanned texts for future reference.
- **Accessibility Controls:** Customizable contrast and adjustable font sizes for improved readability.
- **Language Nuance Recognition:** Specialized AI capabilities to accurately interpret local Indonesian dialects and regional accents.
- **Versatile Scanning:** Robust text recognition from diverse image sources and real-world scenarios.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# ClearScan

ClearScan is an innovative web and mobile application designed to empower individuals with partial vision impairment by converting scanned text into natural-sounding speech—both online and offline. Built to support the Indonesian language with high accuracy, ClearScan addresses everyday challenges such as reading product packaging, documents, and public signage.

---

## Background

In Indonesia, approximately 3.7 million people experience visual impairments, with many suffering from partial blindness that hinders their ability to read. While solutions like Google Lookout and Seeing AI offer OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) functionalities, they are not fully optimized for the Indonesian language and often require a stable internet connection. ClearScan fills this gap by providing a dedicated, accessible solution.

---

## Problem Statement

- **Empowerment:** How can we help individuals with partial vision impairment read text more easily and independently?
- **Accuracy:** How can we improve OCR and TTS performance specifically for Indonesian text, capturing local nuances and accents?
- **Accessibility:** How can we create a lightweight, user-friendly solution that works seamlessly both online and offline?
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** How can we ensure our solution is more effective and affordable than existing alternatives?

---

## Proposed Solution

ClearScan leverages advanced OCR technology to convert text from images or documents into digital text, which is then transformed into speech via a high-quality TTS engine. The application is purposefully engineered to:
- Recognize and accurately process Indonesian text.
- Offer offline functionality for consistent performance.
- Provide user-friendly features that enhance accessibility for individuals with partial vision impairment.

---

## Key Features

- **Text Scanning (OCR):** Quickly converts text from images or documents, optimized for the Indonesian language.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Reads scanned text aloud in a natural voice with adjustable speed; fully functional offline.
- **History Storage:** Automatically saves scanned texts for easy future reference.
- **Customizable Display:** Offers adjustable contrast and text size to enhance readability.
- **Language-Specific Recognition:** Uses AI to accurately interpret the nuances of Indonesian, including regional accents.
- **Image-Based Scanning:** Supports text extraction from various image types in different settings.
